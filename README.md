# AOC2024
All of my code for Advent of Code 2024

Current plan is to do it in Factor, Haskell, and Rust, but it might change later.

* Day1: Factor
* Day2: Factor
* Day3: Factor
* Day4: Factor
* Day5: Factor
* Day6: Factor (suffering)
* Day7: Factor
* Day8: Factor
* Day9: Rust (I was tired from studying and implemented the easiest Rust solution I could think of)
