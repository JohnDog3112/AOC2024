# AOC2024
All of my code for Advent of Code 2024

Current plan is to do it in Factor, Haskell, and Rust, but it might change later.

* Day1: Factor
* Day2: Factor
* Day3: Factor
* Day4: Factor
* Day5: Factor
* Day6: Factor (suffering)
* Day7: Factor
* Day8: Factor
* Day9: Rust (I was tired from studying and implemented the easiest Rust solution I could think of)
* Day10: Rust (finals still)
* Day11: Factor (back to Factor)
* Day12: Factor (pain)
* Day13: Factor
* Day14: Factor part1, Rust part2 (didn't want to do another grid search algo on Factor)
* Day15: Rust, probably sticking with Rust for the rest
* Day16: Rust
* Day17: Rust
* Day18: Rust
* Day19: Rust
* Day20: Rust
